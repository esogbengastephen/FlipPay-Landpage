# Gmail SMTP Configuration
# For Gmail, you'll need to use an App Password instead of your regular password
# To generate an App Password:
# 1. Go to your Google Account settings
# 2. Enable 2-Step Verification
# 3. Go to App Passwords and generate a new app password for "Mail"
# 4. Use that app password as SMTP_PASSWORD

SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-app-password-here

# Email addresses
# FROM_EMAIL: The email address that sends emails (usually same as SMTP_USER)
FROM_EMAIL=your-email@gmail.com

# TO_EMAIL: YOUR business email address where you receive notifications
# This is where you'll get notified when:
# - Someone joins the waitlist
# - Someone submits the contact form
# This is NOT the visitor's email - it's YOUR email to receive notifications
TO_EMAIL=your-email@gmail.com
